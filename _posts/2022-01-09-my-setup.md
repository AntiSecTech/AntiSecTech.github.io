Here I want to give you a brief insight into my setup when I play CTFs. Most of the scenarios relate to virtual machines that I run with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), among others, in addition to [quemu](https://www.qemu.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

<h3><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>ls -l /proc/</h3>
My device is a 12.5" Lenovo X260 from 2016 with an Intel Skylake-Dual Core-Processor i7-6500U with up to 3.4 GHz @4 Cores, 4MB cache with Intel SoC chipset. 16GB PC4-2133MHz DDR4 RAM. 2,5" 86,6GB SSD hard drive and a Mesa Intel HD-Graphics 520.

<h3><i class="fa fa-gears"></i>uname -a</h3>
Debian Linux - Parrot OS 5.0 LTS x86_64<br>
MATE Desktop 1.24.1<br>
Oracle VirtualBox 6.1.26<br>

<h3><i class="fa fa-tasks"></i>Alternative cases</h3>
Virtual machines with recommended settings and various Linux distributions.
 - [Parrot Security](https://parrotsec.org/)
 - [KALI](https://www.kali.org/)
 - [BlackArch](http://www.blackarch.io/)
 - [ArchStrike](https://archstrike.org/)

To be honest, I rarely use the Arch derivatives because I'm more of a Debian user.
